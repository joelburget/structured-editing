# structured-editing

What is this? I'm playing with the idea of editing programs in a structured way. Doing so allows the compiler to do a lot more than we typically expect it to do:

* syntax must always be correct
* structured manipulations
* richer representations
* continuous updating / preview

But those are all grandiose ideas, and this is just an experiment. So don't get your hopes up is all I'm saying. Because we'll get there eventually, but not today.
